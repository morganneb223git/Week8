# Eye Exercise

## In the "Follow Mouse Movement" task, I explored JavaScript events, such as "click" and "mousemove," to dynamically adjust the position of an "eye" element as the mouse moves. The assignment involved extending this functionality to include a second "eye" element for synchronized tracking.

## How To Run
- Save the HTML code in an HTML file (e.g., index.html).
- Save the JavaScript code in a JavaScript file (e.g., eyes.js).
- Ensure both files are in the same directory.
- Open the HTML file in a web browser.
- You'll see two "eyes" that follow your mouse movements on the screen.

## Future Improvements
- Add a "click" event to the "eye" elements to change the color of the "eye".
- Add a "click" event to the "eye" elements to change the size of the "eye".
- Add a "click" event to the "eye" elements to change the shape of the "eye".
